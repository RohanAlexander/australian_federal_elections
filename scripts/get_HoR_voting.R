#### Set up workspace ####
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
# update.packages()


#### Create lists of URLs to scrape and file names to save the PDF as ####
data_to_scrape <- read_csv("inputs/scraping/URLs_for_adam_carr.csv")

address_to_visit <- data_to_scrape$URL
save_name <- data_to_scrape$file_name

save_name <- paste0("txt/", save_name)

dir.create("txt")


#### Create the function that will visit address_to_visit and save to save_name files ####
visit_address_and_save_PDF <-
  function(name_of_address_to_visit,
           name_of_where_to_save) {
    download.file(name_of_address_to_visit, name_of_where_to_save)
    print(paste("Done with", name_of_where_to_save, "at", Sys.time()))  # Helpful so that you know progress when running it on all the records
    Sys.sleep(sample(15:30, 1)) # Space out requests by somewhere between 15 and 30 seconds each
  }

safe_visit_address_and_save_PDF <- safely(visit_address_and_save_PDF)


#### Walk through the lists and get the PDFs ####
# save_name <- save_name[1:2] # testing it works
# address_to_visit <- address_to_visit[1:2] # testing it works
save_name <- save_name[3:length(save_name)] # main run
address_to_visit <- address_to_visit[3:length(address_to_visit)] # main run

walk2(address_to_visit, save_name, ~ safe_visit_address_and_save_PDF(.x, .y))
